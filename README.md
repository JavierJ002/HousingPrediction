# House Price Prediction - Kaggle Ames Dataset
In this project, we begin by exploring the dataset with a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Afterward, we prepare the data to ensure it’s ready for modeling.

Next, we perform feature selection to reduce the risk of overfitting and optimize the performance of our models. We then experiment with various models, fine-tuning their hyperparameters to achieve the best possible results. Finally, we conduct error analysis and apply stacking techniques to further enhance our model’s performance and improve our ranking.

# Project Structure:
**data/:** Contains the raw data, model predictions, trained models, and checkpoints after preprocessing.

**notebooks/:** Comprises four Jupyter notebooks: EDA, Preprocessing, Model & Feature Selection, and Error Analysis + Stacking.

**Scripts/:** Python scripts with functions for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.

**requirements.txt:** A list of dependencies required to run the project locally.

**data_description.txt:** A text file explaining the meaning of each variable in the dataset.

# Considerations
This project is still under development. Currently, I am working on integrating a Neural Network using TensorFlow. The goal is to incorporate this model into our stacking approach, experimenting with different combinations of base learners and meta-learners to push the results even further.
